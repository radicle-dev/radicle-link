//! `radicle-keystore` aims to become the sole abstraction over storage of key
//! material in the Radicle ecosystem.
//!
//! Radicle employs two kinds of keys: ones which may leave your device (e.g.
//! onto an HSM), and ones that shouldn't. For the first kind, we will
//! eventually provide an implementation of [`Keystore`] which interfaces
//! directly with system keychains or hardware devices, while for the second
//! kind matters are a bit more complicated: we recommend to use the
//! [`file::FileStorage`] implementation, which stores keys in encrypted form on
//! the filesystem. This is to discourage (accidental) key sharing via backup or
//! cross-device syncing setups the user might have.
//!
//! The choice of [`crypto::Crypto`] (and relatedly [`pinentry::Pinentry`]) may
//! however be used to store the passphrase for a key-derivation scheme (as
//! employed by [`crypto::Pwhash`]) in some system keychain, or offload
//! encryption entirely to an external system (such as GPG, or a password
//! manager).
