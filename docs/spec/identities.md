# Identities

In order to collaborate on repositories within a consensus-free network, we must
be able to refer to them using a stable identifier. Note that this identifier is
a **statement of intent**: a repository can be described as a collection of
ever-moving leaves of a DAG whose root element is the empty object. Therefore,
the _content_ of a repository is not enough to describe it -- while two views on
the repository may share objects, they may diverge substantially otherwise. Both
views may however state their intent to eventually converge to the same state.

While in principle a random identifier with sufficient entropy would suffice for
the purpose, this would put the burden of deciding which repository views are
_legit_ (for some definition of legit) entirely on the user. Instead, our
approach is to establish an ownership proof, tied to the network identity of a
peer (`PeerId`), or a set of peers, such that repository views can be replicated
according to the trust relationships between peers ("tracking").

Our model is based on The Update Framework (TUF)[@tuf], conceived as a means of
securely distributing software packages.

## Data Model

The identity of a repository is established using a document of the form:

```rust
struct Doc<T, D> {
    replaces: Option<Revision>,
    payload: T,
    delegations: D,
}
```

where:

* `Revision` is a cryptographic hash of a document's contents, such that this
  document is content-addressable by this hash within the storage system.
* `replaces` refers to the previous revision of the document, or none if it is
  the first revision
* `payload` is an extensible, forwards- and backwards-compatible datatype
  containing application-defined metadata about the repository. The protocol
  interprets _some_ of the properties, as described in [Doc Payload].
* `delegations` contains the public keys of key owners who are authorised to
  issue and approve new revisions of the document. The delegation format depends
  on the type of identity being established, as detailed below.

The `Doc` MUST be serialised in canonical form, e.g. [Canonical JSON].

The authenticity of the `Doc` is captured by the following type:

```rust
struct Identity<T, D> {
    id: ContentId,
    root: Revision,
    revision: Revision,
    doc: Doc<T, D>,
    signatures: HashMap<PublicKey, Signature>,
}
```

where:

* `id` is the content-addressable hash of the `Identity` itself
* `root` is the initial revision of the identity `Doc`
* `revision` is the current revision of the identity `Doc`
* `doc` is the `Doc` described by `revision`
* `signatures` contains signatures over the document history, indexed by the public
  keys used. A signature is made over the cryptographic hash of the concatenation
  of the `Revisions` chain, from most recent to the `root`.

An `Identity` describes the attestation of a `Doc`s validity. Attestation chains
MUST be stored as a hash-linked history (each `Identity` refers to its parent)
-- we omit the parent `id` as a field here, as it is not used in the following
sections.

The `root` of a verified `Identity` is the stable identifier of the repository.

### Radicle URNs

Identities are addressable within the Radicle Network by their stable identifier,
encoded as a URN. Radicle URNs are syntactically and functionally equivalent to
URNs as per [@rfc8141], although we have no intention of registering our
namespace with the IANA. r-, q-, and f-components are not currently honoured by
the protocol, and MAY be discarded by recipients.

The syntax of a Radicle URN is defined as follows:

    "rad" ":" protocol ":" root [ "/" path ]

where:

    protocol = "git"
    root     = MULTIBASE(MULTIHASH(id))
    path     = pct-encoded
    id       = BYTES

The `id` is the `root` field of a verified `Identity`, as specified previously.
The `MULTIBASE` and `MULTIHASH` encodings are specified in [@multibase] and
[@multihash], respectively. The preferred alphabet for the multibase encoding is
[@z-base32]. `pct-encoded` is defined in [@rfc3986], and the equivalence rules
as per [@rfc8141] apply.

Within the "git" `protocol` context, the `path` component is interpreted as a
`git` reference (ref), and MUST thus conform to the refname rules as described
in [git-check-ref-format], as if no arguments were given. The prefix "refs/" MAY
be omitted, but not the refs category (i.e. "heads/master" is permitted, but
"master" is not). Valid ref categories are:

    * heads
    * tags
    * remotes
    * rad

An invalid ref category is treated as non-existent.

Without a `path`, a URN is to be treated as if the default value "rad/id" was
given.

Before resolving a `path` to a ref in local storage, the percent-encoding SHALL
be removed.

#### Examples

    rad:git:hwd1yredksthny1hht3bkhtkxakuzfnjxd8dyk364prfkjxe4xpxsww3try
    rad:git:hwd1yredksthny1hht3bkhtkxakuzfnjxd8dyk364prfkjxe4xpxsww3try/refs/heads/next
    rad:git:hwd1yredksthny1hht3bkhtkxakuzfnjxd8dyk364prfkjxe4xpxsww3try/heads/next
    rad:git:hwd1yredksthny1hht3bkhtkxakuzfnjxd8dyk364prfkjxe4xpxsww3try/tags/v0.0.1
    rad:git:hwd1yredksthny1hht3bkhtkxakuzfnjxd8dyk364prfkjxe4xpxsww3try/remotes/hwd1yreb5ugudg6xewxiwotj97iaj31phjdphdiej44x1acer3i45uqnwxw/heads/pu
    rad:git:hwd1yreb5ugudg6xewxiwotj97iaj31phjdphdiej44x1acer3i45uqnwxw/rad/id

### Doc Payload

The `Doc` payload MUST include one of the following structures (but not both)
for interpretation by the protocol:

```rust
struct User {
    /// A short name (nickname, handle), without any prefix such as the `@`
    /// character
    name: String,
}

struct Project {
    /// A short name
    name: String,

    /// A slightly longer description (should fit in a headline)
    description: Option<String>,

    /// The default branch. "master" is assumed for git repositories if
    /// unspecified.
    default_branch: Option<String>,
}
```

There are currently no restrictions on the length (in bytes) of the fields.

Applications MAY add additional payload data, but MUST do so in a way which
unambiguously preserves the shape of the above definitions (see also:
[Serialisation]).

## Verification

Document revisions, as well as authenticity attestations form a hash-linked
chain leading to the initial revision of the document. In order to verify the
authenticity of a given identity attestation (`Identity`), the chain of updates
must be contiguous and subject to the following verification rules.

We can distinguish four levels of validity:

1. **Untrusted**

    The identity document is well-formed, and points to a root object which is
    retrievable from local storage.

2. **Signed**

    The identity carrier passes 1., and is signed by at least one key specified
    in the delegations of the document.

3. **Quorum**

   The identity carrier passes 2., and is signed by a quorum of the keys
   specified in the [delegations](#delegations) of the document (`Q > D/2`).

4. **Verified**

    The identity carrier passes 3., and:

    * The document does not refer to a previous revision, and no previous
      revision is known
    * **Or**, the set of signatures forms a quorum of the [delegations](#delegations)
      of the **previous** revision.

    It is an error if:

    * No previous revision is given, but a parent in the identity attestation
      chain is found
    * A previous revision is given, but the identity attestation chain does not
      yield a parent
    * A previous revision is given, but it is not the same the parent
      attestation refers to
    * The current and parent attestations refer to different `root`s

The verification process can now be described recursively:

```rust
/* State transitions, definitions elided for brevity */
fn signed(i: Untrusted<Identity>) -> Result<Signed<Identity>, Error>;
fn quorum(i: Signed<Identity>) -> Result<Quorum<Identity>, Error>;
fn verified(i: Quorum<Identity>, parent: Option<Verified<Identity>>) -> Result<Verified<Identity>, Error>;

fn verify(
    head: Untrusted<Identity>,
    mut parents: impl Iterator<Item = Untrusted<Identity>>,
) -> Result<Verified<Identity>, Error> {
    let head = quorum(signed(head)?)?;
    let parent = match parents.next() {
        None => Ok(None),
        Some(parent) => verify(parent, parents),
    }?;

    verified(head, parent)
}
```

> **Implementation Notes**:
>
> * The recursive definition is given for brevity, implementations may prefer to
>   walk the history in reverse order.
> * As an optimisation, implementations SHOULD store the result of a successful
>   verification in persistent storage, such that verification of updates can
>   start from the last-good state instead of the history root. Observe,
>   however, that two different `Identity` objects (as identified by their
>   `id`) may attest the same `Doc` revision -- the persistent state SHOULD
>   therefore allow retrieving the set of attesting `Identity`s by `Doc`
>   revision.
> * The `quorum` predicate above SHOULD actually skip over this parent instead
>   of aborting the procedure -- it is possible that a later `Identity` reaches
>   the quorum.

## Delegations

Radicle Link distinguishes two types of identities: personal and project. The
first describes an actor in the system, while the second describes a (software)
project on which one or more actors collaborate. Apart from their payload types
`T`, they differ in their delegations type `D`:

Personal identities can only delegate to anonymous keys, while project
identities MAY attach a personal identity  to a key delegation.

More formally:

```rust
type User<T> = Identity<T, HashSet<PublicKey>>;

enum ProjectDelegation<U> {
    Key(PublicKey),
    User(User<U>),
}

type Project<T, U> = Identity<T, ProjectDelegation<U>>;
```

Per identity document, the `PublicKeys` delegated to MUST form a set. It is, for
example, an error if a `PublicKey` appears in both the document and a `User`
delegations, or within two different `User` delegations.

If a `Project` delegates to a `User`, it MUST do so by including a specific
revision of the `User` document. The replication rules ensure that the
respective `User` histories are replicated as sibling histories [insert link].

If one of these sibling histories is found to not include the delegated-to
revision in its ancestry path, it is said to have **forked**, and signatures
made by one of the `User`s keys after the point of inclusion in the `Project` no
longer count towards the quorum rules. Note that this is only recoverable if a
quorum of valid keys remains on the project, otherwise a [Key Recovery](#key-recovery)
procedure must be invoked on the `Project`.

If a sibling history is NOT **forked** (i.e. it includes the attested revision
in its ancestry path), AND it is **verified**, its key delegations are
considered authoritative for all `Project` attestations between the point the
`User` was delegated to, and the currently known-good head.

> **Implementation Note**: If `User` keys are not reused (i.e. revoked and later
> re-introduced) since the attestation point (which MUST be verified), it is
> sufficient to check for key revocations using the latest known heads of the
> respective histories.

When calculating the **Quorum** or **Verifed** threshold, multiple signatures
made by the set of keys of a `User` SHALL be counted as only one vote towards
the quorum. This prevents unilateral decisions made by a single `User`. We
consider this simple scheme sufficient for the purpose, but more sophisticated
delegations may be supported in the future, such as customising the quorum
threshold, or key roles.

Note that a key revocation event in a sibling `User` history may render the
project unusable if the remaining keys cannot form a quorum. Also note that the
`Project` SHOULD renew the attestation from time to time.

The `delegations` of a `Project` are also referred to as the project's
**maintainers**.

## Key Recovery

> **TODO** Define how to delegate trust to a set of keys `K \ D` for the purpose
> of recovering from key revocations in case the quorum rules can no longer be
> met with the remaining keys. (i.e. "Social Recovery")

## Effect on Replication

Peers MUST NOT replicate repositories whose identities they are unable to
verify. If an update to the identity cannot be verified, they SHOULD keep the
data they already have, but refuse to update it. Peers SHOULD keep the identity
histories regardless of their verification status.

When **cloning** a repository, the attestation history according to the remote
peer is fetched before all other repository contents, and the verification
procedure is run on it. If this does not yield a verified status, the clone is
aborted. The resulting repository state MUST include the attestation histories
of at least a quorum of the delegates as per the remote peer's view of the
identity document. In `git`, the claim that this will be the case can be
determined before fetching the repository contents by examining the advertised
remote refs. If these preconditions are not met, the clone is aborted, and
already fetched data is pruned.

When **fetching** (i.e. updating) a repository, a predetermined set of verified
delegates is already known -- their views of the attestation history SHALL be
fetched first, along with any advertised histories not yet present in the local
repository (as those might be owned by future delegates). The fetching end MUST
now find a valid `Doc` revision near the tips of the available delegate
histories, and pick the most recent one. If two valid identities are found of
which neither is in the ancestry path of the other, the attestation chain is
said to have **forked**. In lieu of a consensus system, it is undecidable which
side of the fork to commit to, and so replication of the attested repository
SHALL refuse any further updates.

> **TODO** Fork detection (i.e. pairwise compare if in same ancestry path, either
> select most recent or flag as forked)

## Git Encoding

In the `git` implementation, a `Doc` corresponds to a `blob` object, stored as
the single entry of a `tree` object, such that its name (acc. to the `tree`) is
equal to the `blob` hash of the _initial_ version of the `Doc`, serialised in
canonical form. That is:

    let name = git hash-object -t blob doc.canonical_form()

An `Identity` corresponds to a `commit` object.

We map the fields as follows:

```rust
/* Simplified git object model */
struct Commit {
    id: Oid,
    tree: Tree,
    message: String,
}

struct Tree {
    id: Oid,
    entries: Vec<TreeEntry>,
}

struct TreeEntry {
    id: Oid,
    name: String,
    object: BlobOrTree,
}

struct Blob {
    id: Oid,
    content: Vec<u8>,
}

/* Mapping (trivial type conversions elided) */
let commit = /* .. */;
let identity = Identity {
    id: commit.id,
    root: commit.tree.entries[0].name,
    revision: tree.id,
    doc: deserialize(first_blob(commit.tree).content),
    signatures: from_trailers(commit.message),
};
```

Where:

* `first_blob` finds the first `TreeEntry` which is of type `blob`.
* `deserialize` is implemented by a standard JSON parser. `User` delegations
  from a `Project` are specified in the `Project`'s `Doc` as URNs, which are
  resolved by parsing a `blob` object of the same name as the URN's `id` field
  below the `tree` entry of type directory named `delegations`.
* `from_trailers` interprets the commit message as per [git-interpret-trailers],
  and extracts the signatures from trailers with the token `x-rad-signature`.

> **TODO** Specify exact format of signature trailer value (BASE64(public key ||
> signature))

The commit chain is stored in a branch at `refs/rad/id`.

> **TODO** Insert repository layout spec as per
> [RFC](../rfc/identity_resolution.md) here

### Serialisation

The `Doc` is serialised in [Canonical JSON] format. However, all ASCII plane
control characters (`U+0000 - U+007F`) MUST be escaped according to [@rfc8259,
Section 7]. Hexadecimal escape sequences MUST be in lower-case. This contradicts
[Canonical JSON], but permits their claim that "Canonical JSON is parsable with
any full JSON parser".

In addition to the shape defined above, a field `version` MUST be included with
a value of `0` (zero) as of this version of the specification.

`Revision` values are serialised as JSON strings, encoded as a [@multihash]
value wrapped in a [@multibase] encoding using the [@z-base32] alphabet.

`PublicKey` values are serialised as JSON strings, which are obtained by
concatenating the `0` byte (as a version identifier) with the Ed25519 scalar
(the public key) encoded as per [@rfc8032], and then wrapping in a [@multibase]
encoding using the [@z-base32] alphabet.

User delegations are serialised as a JSON array of `PublicKey` values. Duplicate
elements MUST be a deserialisation error.

Project delegations are serialised as a JSON array of either `PublicKey` or URN
values without tagging. Duplicate elements MUST be a deserialisation error.

The `payload` is encoded as a JSON object using [@whatwg-url] URLs as the keys,
and JSON objects of the `radicle-link`- or user-specified payload objects as the
values. Implementations MUST validate that a valid `radicle-link` payload is
present in the object, and SHOULD preserve user extensions typed as the JSON
object model. Duplicate URL keys are a deserialisation error.

The URL keys serve as namespaces, as well as version identifiers. Versioning
simplifies schema evolution. However, implementations MUST ensure that they can
interpret both unknown (future) and outdated (past) versions. This specifically
means that the URL keys for `radicle-link` payloads MUST be considered equal iff
their prefix sans the version identifier is equal, and duplicates rejected
accordingly. It is RECOMMENDED that extension namespaces are also constructed
such that the version identifier is the suffix, and `radicle-link`
implementations SHOULD provide prefix-queries on the extension namespaces in a
payload object.

Additionally, empty optional fields SHOULD be included with a value of `null`,
rather than omitting them from the output.

This specification does not devise a schema resolution mechanism based on the
payload URLs, nor does it mandate schema validation, although applications are
free to implement both.

Pending self-hosting, which will allow precise versioning by content-address,
the URLs for `radicle-link` payloads are:

User

: https://radicle.xyz/link/identities/user/v1

Project

: https://radicle.xyz/link/identities/project/v1


The `radicle.xyz` domain is reserved for application payloads defined by the
Radicle Core Team.

#### Examples

A simple example if an initial `Doc`, embedding a Decentralized Identifier (DID)
document [@did-core] in a `User` payload:

```json
{
    "version": 0,
    "replaces": null,
    "payload": {
        "https://radicle.xyz/link/identities/user/v1": {
            "name": "cloudhead"
        },
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1": {
            "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
            "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
            "authentication": [{
                "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
                "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
                "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
                "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
            }],
            "service": [{
                "id":"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs",
                "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
                "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
            }]
        }
    },
    "delegations": [
        "hyn4hnppkiu61kpx91o9n5jtj37brujcgj7yp8d1derwz4fbk3tqjw",
        "hyb8kud543qkfdxkge6ecj6zziuam6w6fqhujgebbfuufmpdxt5uok"
    ]
}
```

Note that the example is **not** in canonical form.

### Workflow

Our construction of the `Identity` from a git commit allows for multiple `id`s
to describe the same revision of the document (and thus be equally valid). This
means that the respective delegates' histories may diverge in their _commit_
histories, but still converge to an agreement on the validity of the attested
document revision.

While this allows for arbitrarily complex workflows (and history topologies), we
RECOMMEND to converge to equal or joined histories. This can be achieved by
selecting a leader to commit the quorum (and the followers adopting this
commit), or settling the vote out-of-band.

As an example, a simple leader-based workflow could proceed as follows:

* Peer `A` proposes a new revision on her view of the `rad/id` branch. The
  revision is signed by `A`'s public key.
* Peers `B` and `C` receive this proposal, and sign it off on their own `rad/id`
  branches by creating a new commit over the same `tree` as the propsal, but
  including their own signatures (they may also include `A`'s signature for
  posterity, but that is not required as the verification procedure will skip
  those commits).
* Peer `A` is also designated as the leader, so after receiving the updates of
  `B` and `C`, she creates a new commit on her branch, merging both `B`'s and
  `C`'s "votes" (an "octopus merge"), and preserving the signature trailers of
  all three.
* `B` and `C` receive this "finalisation" commit, and simply merge it into their
  own branches. This is a fast-forward merge.

### Implementation Notes

Implementations are encouraged to store verification results (including detected
forks) persistently, both for efficiency reasons, and to preserve this state
even if the corresponding repositories are removed from local storage (e.g.
because they reached an irrecoverable state).

This can be implemented without the need for a secondary storage system by
leveraging [git-notes]:

In the private section of the "monorepo" (i.e. outside any namespaces), store a
note for every verified tree object, with the set of commit OIDs which
contributed to this verified state encoded in the note message (e.g.
`x-rad-verified-by: <OID>`). Determining whether a given revision has been
verified before is an `O(1)` operation: only the notes object needs to be
consulted. Verification can proceed incrementally by skipping commits pointing
to pre-verified trees. Note that the notes objects can be loaded into memory
upfront, and that the skipping only requires to read the commit headers from
disk.

Persisting forks requires to annotate commit objects as well, and to update the
tree notes to reflect the new state.

## Security Considerations

* Colluding key owners can force the network into following a _fork_ of an
  already published identity. While peers are _encouraged_ to persist
  information about detected forks, they are not incentivised to keep that
  information forever. After a period of interrupted replication, the fork may
  thus prevail.

* As outlined in [Delegations](#delegations), `User` and `Project` histories are
  not causally related. This allows for censorship attacks, unless this
  relationship is securely established by an external system.

* The security of identity updates rests on the probability of an attacker to
  gain control over a quorum of keys. That is, we can operate on the assumption
  that the individual keys can be in "online" storage, so as long as the breach
  of a minority of the key delegations can be mitigated by the remaining ones.

  This poses a usability problem, however, especially for personal identities:
  users can hardly be expected to have access to `n > 2` devices within an
  acceptable time window in order to finalise an identity update. In practice,
  many will have access to a portable hardware token which provides reasonable
  protection of the keys it stores, and will want to finalise updates
  immediately by only two signatures: by the current workstation + by the
  hardware token.

  A future amendment to this document SHALL specify the rules for marking a key
  delegation as being considered "secure", such that the quorum threshold can be
  computed differently if such a "secure" signature is present.

* Implementations SHOULD limit the download of untrusted identity histories to a
  reasonable size in bytes.
