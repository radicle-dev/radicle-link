=== Motivation

We have generalised the notion of "identity" in `radicle-link` to
simply mean the presence of a document at a conventional location within
a git repository, where the document is subject to certain verification
rules. The hash of the initial document is considered its stable
identifier and encoded as a uniform resource name (URN) of the form
`rad:git:$HASH` (for git repositories). The URN is supposed to be
resolvable on the network into a top-level git repository of the same
name (`$HASH.git`), which is valid iff it contains said identity
document, and the document passes the verification rules.

This creates a problem: an identity document can be signed by one or
more top-level entities (users), whose identity documents may themselves
be signed by one or more top-level entities. Hence, in order to obtain
the first repository and verifying its identity, we need to recurse
indefinitely trying to resolve, clone, and verify the attesting
entities’ repositories.

This is rather impractical from an implementation point of view: the
initial clone has to block on a stack of asynchronous, high-latency
network calls of (potentially) arbitrary depth, and since there is no
availability guarantee nor -incentive, may still fail in the end,
rendering the requested repository unusable.

Hence, we are seeking to a. devise an incentive for the seeder to
provide all data necessary to resolve and verify a repository, and b. to
reduce latency by eliminating gossip queries and git fetches as much as
possible.

=== Overview

A lesser-known feature of the git suite are
<<namespaces>>, which are intended
to provide network access (push/pull) to a _subset_ of a single
repository on the server side. It turns out that this feature is not
magical at all: a namespace is simply a `refs` hierarchy under the
`namespaces` refs category of the "parent" repository. For example:

....
refs/namespaces/foobar/refs/heads/master
....

The namespace is accessed by setting the `$GIT_NAMESPACE` environment
variable, or passing the `--namespace` parameter to the `git`
executable. However, the only commands which respect this are
<<git-upload-pack>>, <<git-receive-pack>>, and
<<git-http-backend>>. When invoked namespaced, they will simply only
consider the `refs` hierarchy below the namespace (`foobar` in the
example).

The fact that no other git command seems to be aware of namespaces
(<<git-gc>> would come to mind) is somewhat surprising, as it is
otherwise not officially endorsed that one may create other categories
apart from `heads`, `tags`, and `remotes` without any issues. Now that
we know this, however, we can find interesting ways to exploit it in
interesting and barely kosher ways.

=== Namespacing

Consider a `radicle-link` peer would store *all* git repositories it is
interested in in a single git repo, and made use of the namespaces
feature to partition it into logical, smaller repos, which can be
checked out individually.

The namespacing scheme could look as follows:

....
# Owner of this monorepo
let PEER_ID;

# Peer tracked by $PEER_ID, either directly or transitively
let TRACKED_PEER_ID;

# Identity hash of the project or user
let IDENTITY;

# Identity hashes of certifiers of $IDENTITY
let CERTIFIER[1..];

$PEER_ID/refs/
`-- namespaces
    `-- $IDENTITY
        `-- refs
            |-- heads <1>
            |-- rad
            |   |-- id <2>
            |   |-- signed_refs <3>
            |   |-- self <4>
            |   `-- ids
            |       |-- $CERTIFIER[1]
            |       `-- $CERTIFIER[2]
            `-- remotes
                `-- $TRACKED_PEER_ID
                    |-- heads
                    `-- rad
                        |-- id
                        |-- signed_refs
                        |-- self
                        `-- ids
                            |-- $CERTIFIER[1]
                            `-- $CERTIFIER[2]
....
<1> code branches owned by $PEER_ID go here
<2> points to the identity document history
<3> signed refs of the peer
<4> points to the identity of $PEER_ID

Note that the *owned* `$CERTIFIER[n]` refs (ie. not those of remotes)
are <<symbolic-refs>>, pointing
to the `rad/id` branch of the respective namespace. For example, if
identity `A` is certified by identity `B`,
`refs/namespaces/A/refs/rad/ids/B` would contain:

....
ref: refs/namespaces/B/refs/rad/id
....

Where tooling ensures that the certifier can only certify if the
certifying identity is present locally (and is logically valid for the
certifier to use for certifying). The symref ensures that the certifying
identity can be updated in one place (its logical repo), and stays
up-to-date at all use sites without maintenance.

The `rad/self` branch identifies `$PEER_ID`, ie. the `rad/id` branch of
the corresponding identity namespace. For example, if the identity of
`$PEER_ID` is `C`, `rad/self` within the context of `$IDENTITY` would be
a symref:

....
ref: refs/namespaces/C/rad/id
....

Any certifiers of the `self` identity must be included under `rad/ids/`.
The `rad/self` branch is equivalent to the contributor file in the
<<radicle-link-spec, radicle-link spec, rev1-draft>>, which is
required if the `refs/heads/` hierarchy of `$PEER_ID` is non-empty (ie.
it is permissible to omit it if `$PEER_ID` does not publish any branches
of their own).

=== Fetching

Fetching (or cloning) would still happen on a per-`$IDENTITY` basis, as
a replication factor equal to the network size is not desirable. We also
need to map owned refs (`refs/heads`) to remotes, and should limit the
number of refs advertised by `git-upload-pack`.

In order to do so, `git-upload-pack --advertise-refs` transparently sets
the namespace to the requested repository identity. Due to the certifier
symrefs, the serving side advertises a "proof" (or perhaps better:
"promise") to be able to include all relevant data (the `rad/id`
branches) in the packfile.

When negotiating the packfile, we do *not* namespace, such that the
requester can access the entire universe as seen by the server. The
refspecs are computed like this (`rad/refs` signature verification
elided, which needs to come first, incurring two additional network
rountrips):

....
# The set of all certifier identity hashes as found in the advertised refs,
# i.e. `unique(refs/rad/ids/* || refs/remotes/**/rad/ids/*)`
procedure certifiers -> Set CertifierIdentity;

# The set of all transitively tracked peers
let TRACKED_PEERS;

# The currently connected-to peer
let CONNECTED_PEER;

for peer in $TRACKED_PEERS
    # We are connected to a tracked peers, so need to map owned to remote
    # branches
    if $peer == $CONNECTED_PEER
        # Code branches may be non-fast-forwarded
        +refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/heads/*:refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/remotes/$peer/refs/heads/*

        # Map the owned id and certifier branches
        refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/rad/id*:refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/remotes/$peer/rad/id*

        # Also map the certifier identities from and to top-level repos.
        # Here, we're only interested in the branches owned by $peer.
        for certifier in certifiers()
            refs/namespaces/$certifier/rad/id*:refs/namespaces/$certifier/refs/remotes/$peer/rad/id*
        end
    else
        # Same as above, but $CONNECTED_PEER doesn't own the code branches
        # (but is -- possibly -- tracking $peer).
        +refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/remotes/$peer/heads/*:refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/remotes/$peer/refs/heads/*

        # Dito
        refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/remotes/$peer/rad/id*:refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/remotes/$peer/rad/id*

        # Map top-level identities (from and to remote $peer)
        for certifier in certifiers()
            refs/namespaces/$certifier/refs/remotes/$peer/rad/id*:refs/namespaces/$certifier/refs/remotes/$peer/rad/id*
        end
    end
end
....

We can now, in a single packfile, receive a "mirror" of the logical
remote repository requested (modulo the mapping of remotely owned
branches to `refs/remotes`), _as well as_ all of the top-level logical
repositories of all certifiers required to verify the identity
document(s). Additionally, also the certifier identities can be
verified, as we can resolve second-degree certifier identities within
the namespace of the respective certifier. This may still not be
sufficient, as recursion depth is not inherently limited by the identity
verification protocol – it is, however, at the network protocol level,
and it is so at a reasonable depth which _should_ be sufficient for most
purposes.

=== Identity Resolution

As every top-level repository is strictly self-contained, the identity
can be verified without leaving the namespace.

Note that, although technically tolerated by the verification algorithm,
we reject history rewrites. This simplifies determining the latest known
revision of any given identity: across namespaces, multiple branches
pointing to the same identity exist, yet may point to different
revisions. As their histories must be linear, we can simply pick the
most recent tip across namespaces.

=== Working Copies

The astute reader will have noticed that our namespacing scheme takes
the liberty to introduce another refs category, `rad`, which is not
well-known by the git suite. The reason for this is that we can now
trivially obtain a working copy of just the logical repository we want
to work with, while hiding "special" branches:

....
[remote "rad"]
    url = file://path/to/monorepo.git
    fetch = +refs/namespaces/$IDENTITY/refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/rad/refs/heads/*
....

One issue remains, however: as we’re embracing the "bazaar" style of
development, we also want to see the branches of the peers we’re
tracking when running `git branch` in the working copy – however, a
`PEER_ID` is not very meaningful in this context. We need to inspect the
`rad/self` identity metadata in order to find nicknames, and generate
human-readable remote tracking branch names for the fetchspec.

Since the set of tracked peers may change over time, we cannot expect
the user to run a re-generate command periodically, modifying the git
config of the working copy. Luckily,
<<git-config>> supports includes, so
the remote configuration can be managed entirely by `librad`, while in
the working copy’s config it reduces to:

....
[include]
    path = /path/to/managed.inc
....

Note that we also need to decide on the `HEAD` (ie. default branch to
check out), but since this is subject to workflow preferences, and
dependent on the verification result, a discussion is outside the scope
of this document.

=== Alternative Approaches

A similar effect, even exposing the same namespacing scheme on the git
protocol level, could be achieved by leaving top-level repositories
standalone, but mutually linking their object databases via
<<alternates>>.
An advantage would be potentially more efficient
<<repack>>s and resulting packfile
layout. Disadvantages include handling of symbolic refs, which would
require filesystem-level symbolic links, or a custom `refdb`, and
handling of repository deletion, which would require keeping track of a
refcount, and prevent removal before it has reached zero.

=== Drawbacks

* The use of symrefs _below_ the `refs` hierarchy is somewhat
unorthodox. As symrefs were invented to replace actual filesystem
symbolic links (which are not entirely portable), it seems unlikely they
would eventually stop working. If they did, we could still revert to
symlinks again, and accept that this may limit platform choice for
users.
* The `refs/rad` category is obviously also not entirely kosher, but
since there are no hints in the git source code that `refs/namespaces`
is treated specially, there is no reason to believe this would suddenly
stop working. If it did, the only thing that would get more involved is
the working copy branch mapping (which is managed).
* Lastly, with git being very much IO-bound, there are limits to
(ab)using it as a giant monorepo. The precedence for this are Facebook
moving to mercurial-based <<eden>>, and Microsoft developing
<<VFSforGit>>. However, there are also possibilities to mitigate
scaling issues once they arise.  One way is outlined in
<<Alternative Approaches>>, but it is also
feasible to replace the object and refs database backends entirely.

=== Conclusion

Overall, the risks seem manageable, and the reduced complexity for
obtaining, updating, and verifying `radicle-link`-enabled git
repositories appear to outweigh them.

As Google and Facebook knew already, all source control problems can be
solved by a monorepo, and they can’t be wrong, can they?
